## About
The Mini-Max algorithm is a fundamental decision-making technique used in game theory and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we present the implementation of the Mini-Max algorithm in a general context to showcase its functionality and its application to the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. We aim to determine the best outcome that the maximizer or minimizer can achieve in both scenarios. Through this work, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of the Mini-Max algorithm in various two-player zero-sum games

## Future Scope
1. Alpha-Beta Pruning: Enhance the algorithm's efficiency by pruning unnecessary nodes, making
it faster.
2. Heuristic Evaluation: Implement heuristic functions to estimate game state values, allowing for
scalability to more complex games.
3. Adaptation to Other Games: Extend the algorithm to more complex games like Chess or
Connect Four, dealing with larger state spaces.
4. Machine Learning Integration: Combine with machine learning for more adaptive AI, using
techniques like reinforcement learning.
5. User Interface Enhancements: Improve the game's UI, add difficulty levels, multiplayer
options, and detailed move explanations.
6. Educational Tools: Develop interactive tutorials and visualizations to teach algorithms, game
theory, and AI concepts.
